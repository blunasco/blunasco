## Kamusta? 

Welcome to my corner of learning, where science meets creativity, and code becomes a tool for problem-solving. I’m a forensic lab analyst by day and a student all year round, interested in beautifully presented data-driven insights and always aiming to turning scarcity into innovation. From building public health tools to crafting workflows that optimize processes, I’m eager to explore ways to blend science, tech, and creativity to make meaningful impact. Please join me on my journey. 

Ingat!
