Kamusta? 

Welcome to my corner of learning, where science meets creativity, and code becomes a tool for problem-solving. I’m a forensic lab analyst by day, a student all year round,  and a former orb weaver trainer🕸️. Interested in beautifully presented data-driven insights and always aiming to turn scarcity into innovation. From building public health tools to preserving drift wood as an art installation -  I’m eager to explore ways to blend science, tech, and creativity to make meaningful impact. Please join me on my journey. 

Ingat!
